For this project we will be performing Analysis of a brain troke dataset, we will be trying to predict if the patient is likely to have a brain stroke. The features of the data are as follows:

Features:

2) age: age of the patient

3) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension

4) heart disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease

5) ever-married: "No" or "Yes"

6) worktype: "children", "Govtjov", "Neverworked", "Private" or "Self-employed"

7) Residencetype: "Rural" or "Urban"

8) avgglucoselevel: average glucose level in blood

9) bmi: body mass index

10) smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*

11) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not

*Note: "Unknown" in smoking_status means that the information is unavailable for this patient
